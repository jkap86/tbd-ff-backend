## How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Flutter App
```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter run
```

### 3. Test Flow
1. Navigate to a league
2. Click "Trades" button (need to add this to league details screen)
3. Click "Propose Trade" FAB
4. Select a team to trade with
5. Add players from both sides (Note: MVP shows "No players available" - this is OK for basic testing)
6. Add optional message
7. Click "Propose Trade"
8. Check that trade appears in "Pending" tab
9. On other user's device (or switch accounts), accept or reject
10. Verify real-time updates via WebSockets
11. Check that accepted trades move to "History" tab

## Known Limitations (MVP)

### Not Implemented Yet
❌ Draft pick trading (future feature)
❌ Commissioner review/veto
❌ League voting on trades
❌ Trade deadline enforcement
❌ Trade expiry (auto-reject after X hours)
❌ Trade value analysis
❌ Player details in trade builder (shows "No players available")
❌ Notification system for trade proposals

### MVP Simplifications
- **Player Selection**: Currently shows empty list in propose trade screen
  - Players need to be fetched and displayed
  - Can manually test by passing player IDs via API
- **Immediate Processing**: Trades are processed immediately upon acceptance
  - No review period
  - No veto system
- **Basic Validation**: Only checks roster ownership
  - Doesn't check roster size limits
  - Doesn't check position requirements
  - Doesn't check IR/Taxi restrictions

## API Testing with cURL

### Propose a Trade
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/trades/propose \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "league_id": 1,
    "proposer_roster_id": 1,
    "receiver_roster_id": 2,
    "players_giving": [100, 101],
    "players_receiving": [200, 201],
    "message": "Fair trade?"
  }'
```

### Accept a Trade
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/trades/1/accept \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "roster_id": 2
  }'
```

### Get League Trades
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/leagues/1/trades \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Database Schema

### trades table
```sql
id, league_id, proposer_roster_id, receiver_roster_id, status,
proposer_message, rejection_reason, proposed_at, responded_at,
processed_at, created_at, updated_at
```

### trade_items table
```sql
id, trade_id, from_roster_id, to_roster_id, player_id,
player_name, created_at
```

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

### High Priority
1. **Fix Player Selection** - Show actual players in trade builder
2. **Add Trades Button** - Add to league details screen navigation
3. **Trade Notifications** - Push notifications for new proposals
4. **Transaction History** - Link trades to transaction log

### Medium Priority
5. **Trade Deadline** - Configurable week cutoff
6. **Trade Expiry** - Auto-reject after 48 hours
7. **Commissioner Controls** - Veto and force-process trades
8. **Trade Value** - Show fair value calculations

### Low Priority
9. **Draft Pick Trading** - Add future picks table and UI
10. **League Voting** - Vote to approve/veto trades
11. **Trade Block** - Mark players as available
12. **Trade Suggestions** - AI-powered recommendations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Propose trade via UI
- [ ] Propose trade via API
- [ ] Accept trade
- [ ] Reject trade
- [ ] Cancel trade
- [ ] View league trades
- [ ] View roster trades
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Transaction records created
- [ ] Players moved between rosters correctly
- [ ] Error handling (invalid roster, unauthorized, etc.)

---

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ Database indexes on foreign keys
- ✅ Atomic transactions for trade processing
- ✅ WebSocket room-based pub/sub (per league)
- ✅ Trade history pagination ready (add offset/limit later)

---

## Security

- ✅ Authentication required for all trade actions
- ✅ Ownership validation (can only trade own players)
- ✅ Roster membership validation (both in same league)
- ✅ No self-trading
- ✅ Status validation (can't accept/reject non-pending)

---

**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours
**Status**: Ready for testing
**Next Action**: Test basic trade flow and add player selection UI
