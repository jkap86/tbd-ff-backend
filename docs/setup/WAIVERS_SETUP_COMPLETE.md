## 🔧 API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication:

```
POST   /api/leagues/:leagueId/waivers/claim
GET    /api/leagues/:leagueId/waivers/claims
GET    /api/rosters/:rosterId/waivers/claims
DELETE /api/waivers/claims/:claimId
POST   /api/leagues/:leagueId/waivers/process
POST   /api/leagues/:leagueId/transactions/free-agent
GET    /api/leagues/:leagueId/transactions
GET    /api/leagues/:leagueId/players/available
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

### FAAB System
- Each roster starts with 100 FAAB budget
- Submit claims with bid amounts
- Highest bid wins when waivers process
- Bid amount is deducted from winner
- Losing bids are refunded

### Processing Schedule
- **Automatic**: Daily at 3:00 AM UTC
- **Manual**: Commissioner can trigger via API

### Free Agents
- Players not on waivers can be added immediately
- No bid required
- No waiting period

### Real-Time Updates
- Socket events broadcast claim submissions
- Processing results sent to all league members
- Free agent pickups show up instantly
